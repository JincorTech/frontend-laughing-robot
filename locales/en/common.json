      "text": "Jincor is a platform which will allow any business to work with smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments easily with no legal, technical, or operational complications and in a cost-efficient manner. While existing solutions offer to solve just one problem at a time, our team build up a useful, secure and easy-to-use product, which will include smart contracts constructor, cryptocurrency payments, and even a digital arbitration system to work out the right judgements on unclear matters related to smart contracts performance. In the end, Jincor aims to integrate all companies, employees and business assets into a unified blockchain ecosystem, which will make business relations truly transparent, effective and reliable."

      "text": "A recent Cambridge University <a href='https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf' target='_blank'>study</a> estimates between 2.9 million and 5.8 million people now use cryptocurrency wallets worldwide in 2017. There are also more than 100,000 merchants, including <a href='https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/06/5-brand-name-businesses-that-currently-accept-bitc.aspx' target='_blank'>giants</a> like Microsoft, Paypal, DISH Network, Intuit, and Overstock, who trust bitcoin enough to accept it as a means of payment. And there is nothing amazing here: using cryptocurrency in business means lower transaction fees, high-speed processing and complete elimination of fraud. However, most companies are still unable to use it for intercorporate settlements — cryptocurrency transactions involve anonymity, which has nothing to do with taxation and accounting of organizations. At Jincor companies will be able to use verified digital wallets to carry out transparent and trackable b2b cryptocurrency payments, knowing exactly who they pay to with “know your customer” principle applied."

    "2": {
      "title": "Easy-to-use and legally binding smart contracts",
      "text": "Smart contracts are a great cost-saving tool for business, since they significantly cut accounting costs, raise trust between counterparties and eliminate human factor errors. According to a recent Accenture <a href='https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/blockchain-technology-could-reduce-investment-banks-infrastructure-costs-by-30-percent-according-to-accenture-report.htm' target='_blank'>research</a>, published at the beginning of 2017, investment banks alone could save up to $12 billion per year by adopting blockchain and smart contracts. But still, most small and medium businesses are unable to implement smart contracts due to their expensiveness and technological complexity. To address this issue, Jincor will provide corporate smart contracts templates, which will cut the cost of their implementation from today's approximate of $5,000-7,000 (just have a look at blockchain developers’ <a href='https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blockchain-salaries-go-parabolic-you-can-make-a-fortune-20170605' target='_blank'>salaries</a> and take into consideration that coding and proper security testing of a smart contract requires many working hours of a qualified professional) to roughly $100-500 per contract by removing the need to actually program them and make smart contracts creation genuinely easy even for users with no technical skills."

    "3": {
      "title": "Decentralised Arbitration system",
      "text": "Lack of proper legislative base in the field seems to be the most significant challenge preventing smart contracts and cryptocurrencies from wider adoption. According to the <a href='http://bitlegal.io/list.php' target='_blank'>data</a> from Bitlegal, which tracks evolving regulatory landscape of blockchain technologies around the world, at the moment there are only 62 countries explicitly allowing their usage, but even there smart contracts are not regulated by clear, widely-adopted and well-known rules. In practice, it means that if you have signed a smart contract with your business partner, and you are dissatisfied with some of his actions, there are virtually no means for you to uphold your rights, as the contract is performed automatically and there are no courts or some regulatory bodies at all. Jincor solves this problem by providing a decentralized arbitration system, where organizations will be able to file a claim related to smart contract performance and get an unbiased judgment of several arbitrators, randomly picked from the list of companies which have gained a good reputation while using the platform and dealing with other participants on similar matters."

      },
      "2": {
        "q": "2. What problem do you solve?",
        "a": "Jincor solves the problem of technological barriers which stand on the way to mass integration of smart contracts and removes legal difficulties for the usage of cryptocurrencies, making the blockchain technology accessible to any business. At the moment the integration of smart contracts and cryptocurrencies is a very complex and expensive process. Development costs for some of the simplest and most basic smart contracts vary from $5 000 to $10 000 (just have a look at blockchain developers’ salaries and take into consideration that coding and proper security testing of a smart contract require many working hours of a qualified professional). We plan to cut the costs to roughly $100-500 per contract by removing the need to program them and make smart contracts creation genuinely easy even for users with no technical skills."
      },
      "3": {
        "q": "3. How do you solve them?",
        "a": "We plan to provide organizations with a simple and intuitive interface for creating and signing of smart contracts. Our platform will work for the end user as a constructor where organizations will be able to set appropriate parameters and agreement terms, attach their cryptocurrency wallets and write the smart contract to a private blockchain in two clicks. In addition, our company is going to carry out legal support for cryptocurrency transactions, similar to how banks support their clients in certain cases."
      },
      "4": {
        "q": "4. How it will work?",
        "a": "The working process on Jincor is as follows: upon registration each company gets a digital card, which it will need to verify through Jincor partner companies (banks, law firms) through KYC system, it means bind your card to a company from the real world. After verification the company gets access to enterprise cryptowallets and smart contracts templates. Since Jincor is an intercorporate environment, you can easily find a new business partner, or invite an existing one to Jincor."

      "6": {
        "q": "6. Which countries Jincor is targeting first?",
        "a": "Currently, more than 150 companies from all over the world have requested access to Jincor beta testing, which is scheduled to begin in October. After successful completion of ICO, Jincor are plans develop and promote the product towards countries in which legislative initiatives are as loyal as possible to crypto-currencies, and the market and business are sufficiently innovative to start using the tools and capabilities of smart contracts. First of all, we refer the markets of Southeast Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea) and European. Jincor will work simultaneously in both directions, creating favorable conditions for business and promotion."

        "q": "7. What is already done?",

      },
      "21": {
        "q": "21. What are the obstacles in using cryptocurrency now?",
        "a": "One of the primary reasons is the anonymity of transactions, which is absolutely inappropriate for organizations.

      "22": {
        "q": "22. Can I use cryptocurrency payments on Jincor if my country did not legalize cryptocurrency?",

      },
      "25": {
        "q": "25. Why should my company use smart contracts?",
        "a": "If business owner wants to save thousands of dollars a year and get rid of many troubles related to unscrupulous business partners and human factor mistakes, the answer is certainly yes. Smart contracts, which are, actually, a self-executing code on blockchain that automatically implements the terms of an agreement between parties, can be used every time when there is a clear cause-consequence logic. Imagine this: you want to order some goods from a new business partner, but there is always a trap of mistrust – you don’t want to pay until getting your goods, and your partner doesn’t want to ship it until getting prepayment. What if it’s a cheat? With smart contracts, it’s possible to sign an automatically performed and unbreakable agreement with certain predefined terms: as soon as you receive the delivery, your counterparty gets the funds. As simple as that. No more fraud, massive amounts of paperwork, and also intermediaries like banks, lawyers, brokers, and notaries, which are usually associated with significant costs.

      },
      "26": {
        "q": "26. What is the legal effect of smart contracts?",
        "a": "The legal validity of digital documents may vary in different jurisdictions. But even if the legal status of smart contracts is not yet defined in your country, you can still use them in your business activities — you will just need to have hard copies of such contracts as well."
      },
      "27": {
        "q": "27. Can I make smart contracts which execution depends on actions in the real world?",
        "a": "At the moment many projects take their efforts to create links between the digital environment and real world, but we estimate that it will take several more years to develop this possibility. We are now focused on developing of smart contracts that can be fully performed in the digital world — for example, labour and property agreements, or corporate contracts related to digital services."
      },
      "28": {
        "q": "28. It turns out that when using smart-contracts everyone will see my data?",
        "a": "No. We perfectly understand the business requirements for data confidentiality, so all transactions will be carried out in a private corporate Blockchain. This is our development based on Hyperledger technologies."
      },
      "29": {
        "q": "29. Why is this needed?",
        "a": "In case when the execution logic of a contract is not defined clearly enough, the parties to the agreement may be drown to a dispute. This is particularly so with the cases related to the real-world actions and goods. Offline, there are clear regulatory mechanisms for such issues: should the parties have any disputes related to the contract performance, they can always take legal action. The similar patterns should be implemented within the digital jurisdiction, too. For that very reason we created Jincor Arbitrage, which help settling disputes related to the execution of smart contracts."
      },
      "30": {
        "q": "30. How it works?",
        "a": "The proceedings will be hold in an anonymous digital room, where claimant and defendant will be able to bring charges, offer evidence and witness statements. In order to exclude possible bias and corruption elements, arbitrators will remain unknown to the parties to a dispute. At the end of the trial the defeated party will get a commitment requirement. The ignorance of court requirements will result in losing reputation and business relations, which are associated with a digital ID of the participant. An additional reason for meeting arbitration system requirements will be the fact that all participants of the ecosystem will have access to a unified database, which will contain information on all previous arbitration proceedings. Thus, before signing a contract the parties will be able to assess each other’s reliability."
      },
      "31": {
        "q": "31. How are judges chosen to handle arbitration disputes?",
        "a": "Following the principles of decentralised society, arbitrators will be chosen by mathematical algorithms, which regard to their digital reputation, sphere of competence and practical experience in specific jurisdiction and economic sector. Arbitrators’ fees will be defined in advance and paid by the losing party at the end of proceedings. However, on early stages arbitrators may offer their service for free to raise reputation."
      },
      "32": {
        "q": "32. Why should I trust it?",
        "a": "In Jincor jurisdiction smart contracts functionality will be available only to verified users. In blockchain environment, just like in the real world, a bad reputation will close many doors and impede the future development of organisation."
      },
      "33": {
        "q": "33. What is your action plan after the ICO?",
        "a": "After the ICO we plan to focus on the product development, getting to the global market and providing legal support to our clients."
      },
      "34": {
        "q": "34. When your product will be fully ready?",
        "a": "Product development is a constant activity. If we talk about the implementation of basic technologies for cryptocurrency settlements, smart contracts, and arbitration system, then, according to our road map, this functionality will be available as early as in 2018. The functional available is already described in Question #7"
