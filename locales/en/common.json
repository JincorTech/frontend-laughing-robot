While existing solutions offer to solve just one problem at a time, our team build up a useful, secure and easy-to-use product, which will include smart contracts constructor, cryptocurrency payments, and even a digital arbitration system to work out the right judgements on unclear matters related to smart contracts performance. In the end, Jincor aims to integrate all companies, employees and business assets into a unified blockchain ecosystem, which will make business relations truly transparent, effective and reliable."

      "text": "A recent Cambridge University <a href='https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf' target='_blank'>study</a> estimates between 2.9 million and 5.8 million people now use cryptocurrency wallets worldwide in 2017. There are also more than 100,000 merchants, including <a href='https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/06/5-brand-name-businesses-that-currently-accept-bitc.aspx' target='_blank'>giants</a> like Microsoft, Paypal, DISH Network, Intuit, and Overstock, who trust bitcoin enough to accept it as a means of payment. And there is nothing amazing here: using cryptocurrency in business means lower transaction fees, high-speed processing and complete elimination of fraud. However, most companies are still unable to use it for intercorporate settlements — cryptocurrency transactions involve anonymity, which has nothing to do with taxation and accounting of organizations. At Jincor companies will be able to use verified digital wallets to carry out transparent and trackable b2b cryptocurrency payments, knowing exactly who they pay to with “know your customer” principle applied."

      "title": "Easy-to-use and legally binding smart contracts",
      "text": "Smart contracts are a great cost-saving tool for business, since they significantly cut accounting costs, raise trust between counterparties and eliminate human factor errors. According to a recent Accenture <a href='https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/blockchain-technology-could-reduce-investment-banks-infrastructure-costs-by-30-percent-according-to-accenture-report.htm' target='_blank'>research</a>, published at the beginning of 2017, investment banks alone could save up to $12 billion per year by adopting blockchain and smart contracts. But still, most small and medium businesses are unable to implement smart contracts due to their expensiveness and technological complexity. To address this issue, Jincor will provide corporate smart contracts templates, which will cut the cost of their implementation from today's approximate of $5,000-7,000 (just have a look at blockchain developers’ <a href='https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blockchain-salaries-go-parabolic-you-can-make-a-fortune-20170605' target='_blank'>salaries</a> and take into consideration that coding and proper security testing of a smart contract requires many working hours of a qualified professional) to roughly $100-500 per contract by removing the need to actually program them and make smart contracts creation genuinely easy even for users with no technical skills."

      "title": "Decentralised Arbitration system",
      "text": "Lack of proper legislative base in the field seems to be the most significant challenge preventing smart contracts and cryptocurrencies from wider adoption. According to the <a href='http://bitlegal.io/list.php' target='_blank'>data</a> from Bitlegal, which tracks evolving regulatory landscape of blockchain technologies around the world, at the moment there are only 62 countries explicitly allowing their usage, but even there smart contracts are not regulated by clear, widely-adopted and well-known rules. In practice, it means that if you have signed a smart contract with your business partner, and you are dissatisfied with some of his actions, there are virtually no means for you to uphold your rights, as the contract is performed automatically and there are no courts or some regulatory bodies at all. Jincor solves this problem by providing a decentralized arbitration system, where organizations will be able to file a claim related to smart contract performance and get an unbiased judgment of several arbitrators, randomly picked from the list of companies which have gained a good reputation while using the platform and dealing with other participants on similar matters."

        "a": "Jincor is a platform, which simplifies the usage of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract' target='_blank'>smart contracts</a> and allows legally using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency' target='_blank'>cryptocurrencies</a> while doing business. The main idea is to let organisations enter into smart contracts</a> with their employees and business partners without any technical insight."
      },
      "2": {
        "q": "2. What problem do you solve?",
        "a": "Jincor solves the problem of technological barriers which stand on the way to mass integration of smart contracts and removes legal difficulties for the usage of cryptocurrencies, making the blockchain technology accessible to any business. At the moment the integration of smart contracts and cryptocurrencies is a very complex and expensive process. Development costs for some of the simplest and most basic smart contracts vary from $5 000 to $10 000. According to <a href='https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/smart-contracts.pdf' target='_blank'>Copgemini</a>, the use of smart contracts instead of paper contracts can save up to $960 per contract, which for the US insurance industry alone could result in $21 billion annual cost savings."
      },
      "3": {
        "q": "3. How do you solve them?",
        "a": "We plan to provide organizations with a simple and intuitive interface for creating and signing of smart contracts. Our platform will work for the end user as a constructor where organizations will be able to set appropriate parameters and agreement terms, attach their cryptocurrency wallets and write the smart contract to a private blockchain in two clicks. In addition, our company is going to carry out legal support for cryptocurrency transactions, similar to how banks support their clients in certain cases."
      },
      "4": {
        "q": "4. How it will work?",
        "a": "The working process on Jincor is as follows: upon registration each company gets a digital card, which it will need to verify through Jincor partner companies (banks, law firms) through <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer' target='_blank'>KYC</a> system, it means bind your card to a company from the real world. After verification the company gets access to enterprise cryptowallets and smart contracts templates. Since Jincor is an intercorporate environment, you can easily find a new business partner, or invite an existing one to Jincor."
      },
      "5": {
        "q": "5. Who is your target customer?",
        "a": "Our target client is small and medium business, aimed primarily at international activities."
      },
      "6": {
        "q": "6. Which countries Jincor is targeting first?",
        "a": "Jincor is primarily focused on those countries, which already have cryptocurrency legislation. More information <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory' target='_blank'>here</a>. At the moment, our lawyers are carrying out legal expertise of the world's leading jurisdictions to work out a promotion strategy."

      "7": {
        "q": "7. What is already done?",
        "a": "Up to now, we have developed a core module of the product, which allows to sign up a company, fill in all the necessary information, invite employees and define their functional roles within the organization. There is also a messenger for inter- and intracorporate communications, which will integrate cryptocurrency payments and smart contracts in the future."

      "8": {
        "q": "8. How long have you been developing your product?",

        "q": "11. Is there actual interest from the companies in using cryptocurrency?",
        "a": "Cryptocurrencies are now used on a daily basis by as many as 100,000 organisations around the world, including giants like Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, WordPress, PayPal, Bloomberg and Square.

      "12": {
        "q": "12. What are the obstacles in using cryptocurrency now?",
        "a": "One of the primary reasons is the anonymity of transactions, which is absolutely inappropriate for organizations. Moreover, companies need financial instruments, such as letters of credit, collection of payments, overdrafts, and also legal support for transactions. Up to now, there is no such product in the crypto world."
      },
      "13": {
        "q": "13. Can I use cryptocurrency payments on Jincor if my country did not legalize cryptocurrency?",
        "a": "Unfortunately no. The absence of a legal status of cryptocurrency in your country will create difficulties in keeping accounting and tax reporting, and may lead to unintentional violation of the law."

      "14": {
        "q": "14. Which cryptocurrencies are used in Jincor?",

      "16": {
        "q": "16. Why should my company use smart contracts?",
        "a": "Smart contracts have a range of fundamantal benefits, such as autonomy, speed, cost saving and accuracy. You can read more on this in <a href='http://telegra.ph/How-to-legally-use-cryptocurrencies-in-corporate-payments-08-01' target='_blank'>our article</a>."
      },
      "17": {
        "q": "17. What is the legal effect of smart contracts?",
        "a": "The legal validity of digital documents may vary in different jurisdictions. But even if the legal status of smart contracts is not yet defined in your country, you can still use them in your business activities — you will just need to have hard copies of such contracts as well.

      },
      "18": {
        "q": "18. Can I make smart contracts which execution depends on actions in the real world?",
        "a": "At the moment many projects take their efforts to create links between the digital environment and real world, but we estimate that it will take several more years to develop this possibility. We are now focused on developing of smart contracts that can be fully performed in the digital world — for example, labour and property agreements, or corporate contracts related to digital services."
      },
      "19": {
        "q": "19. It turns out that when using smart-contracts everyone will see my data?",
        "a": "No. We perfectly understand the business requirements for data confidentiality, so all transactions will be carried out in a private corporate Blockchain. This is our development based on Hyperledger technologies. plan to develop a private enterprise blockchain based on Hyperledger technologies."
      },
      "20": {
        "q": "20. Why is this needed?",
        "a": "In case when the execution logic of a contract is not defined clearly enough, the parties to the agreement may be drown to a dispute. This is particularly so with the cases related to the real-world actions and goods. Offline, there are clear regulatory mechanisms for such issues: should the parties have any disputes related to the contract performance, they can always take legal action. The similar patterns should be implemented within the digital jurisdiction, too. For that very reason we created Jincor Arbitrage, which help settling disputes related to the execution of smart contracts."
      },
      "21": {
        "q": "21. How it works?",
        "a": "The proceedings will be hold in an anonymous digital room, where claimant and defendant will be able to bring charges, offer evidence and witness statements. In order to exclude possible bias and corruption elements, arbitrators will remain unknown to the parties to a dispute. At the end of the trial the defeated party will get a commitment requirement. The ignorance of court requirements will result in losing reputation and business relations, which are associated with a digital ID of the participant. An additional reason for meeting arbitration system requirements will be the fact that all participants of the ecosystem will have access to a unified database, which will contain information on all previous arbitration proceedings. Thus, before signing a contract the parties will be able to assess each other’s reliability."
      },
      "22": {
        "q": "22. How are judges chosen to handle arbitration disputes?",
        "a": "Following the principles of decentralised society, arbitrators will be chosen by mathematical algorithms, which regard to their digital reputation, sphere of competence and practical experience in specific jurisdiction and economic sector. Arbitrators’ fees will be defined in advance and paid by the losing party at the end of proceedings. However, on early stages arbitrators may offer their service for free to raise reputation."
      },
      "23": {
        "q": "23. Why should I trust it?",
        "a": "In Jincor jurisdiction smart contracts functionality will be available only to verified users. In blockchain environment, just like in the real world, a bad reputation will close many doors and impede the future development of organisation."
      },
      "24": {
        "q": "24. Why do you need ICO?",
        "a": "We run ICO in order to raise funding for the further development of the platform and promotion of blockchain technologies in the corporate environment."
      },
      "25": {
        "q": "25. How will the tokens be distributed?",
        "a": "Total supply of tokens is 35 000 000 JCR. The distribution structure is as follows: 80% of the tokens will be put on sale during pre-ICO and ICO (4 and 76% respectively), 8% will be distributed among the escrow, advisors and bug bounty participants, and another 12% will stay at Jincor for further research and development."
